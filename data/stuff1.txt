Transformer architectures are central to the development of modern machine learning models, especially in natural language processing (NLP). These architectures rely on the transformer model that uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words irrespective of their position in the input sequences. This mechanism allows the model to capture complex dependencies and improve on tasks like translation and text generation.
Tokenizers are tools used to convert raw text into a format that can be processed by machine learning models. They work by breaking down text into smaller pieces, such as words, subwords, or characters, which are then converted into numerical data. This preprocessing step is critical for natural language processing applications and influences the performance of the models.
Positional encoders add information to model inputs in transformer networks to represent the position of tokens in the sequence. Since transformers do not inherently process sequence order, positional encoding is necessary to give the model a sense of word order which helps in understanding and generating language. These encoders can be implemented in various ways, such as through sine and cosine functions or learned embeddings.

In the context of language models, it helps the model focus on important words or phrases when processing or generating text, improving the model's ability to understand context and nuances in language.
Training is the process of teaching a machine learning model to perform a specific task by adjusting its parameters. This involves providing the model with a large amount of labeled data, allowing it to learn from examples. For language models, this usually means learning from vast amounts of text to understand language patterns, grammar, and context.
Inferencing is the stage in machine learning where a trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data. For language models, this often involves tasks such as translating text, answering questions, or generating text based on a given prompt.
